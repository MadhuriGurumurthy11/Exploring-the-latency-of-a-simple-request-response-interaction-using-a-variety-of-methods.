# Exploring-the-latency-of-a-simple-request-response-interaction-using-a-variety-of-methods.



In computer network latency is an expression of how much time it takes for a packet of data to get from one designated point to another. This can be represented in a request-response interaction as the time required for a network communication to travel from the source to the destination and back to the source. In this project, we analyze the expected performance considering the protocol header overhead, number of packets sent and propose a framework to evaluate the findings of the simulation. This has been achieved by carefully conducting an experiment, performing statistical analysis and quantitative comparisons of the timings.
